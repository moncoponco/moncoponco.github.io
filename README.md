About the project development:


I began the project with the goal to put together my extensive collection of images collected in the last year. These images are of patterns of lights and shades that I find appealing. 


I knew going in that I would want words to take the visitor to a gallery, but I was unsure how the gallery and the word list would be organized. 

I did a few low-fidelity sketches and then moved to figma to play around with style and layout. See images below!

In terms of UI styling, I was interested in brutalist websites. I chose this aesthetic because it fit well with the subject of the images, and because I personally find it beautiful! 

Overall, I am very satisfied with the results.

The greater percentage of the pictures were taken by me, a small portion were sent to me by friends.
