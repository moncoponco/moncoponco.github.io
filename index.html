        <dd>notes on tags: gestures leaving behind a name, a symbol, a twist. Claiming local, territory, been there and done that. Illegal at night, or day, quick to not get caught. Sometimes on window panes that leave a shade behind, calligraphy and outlines, tags washed or fresh on surfaces that react and compliment.</dd>

        <dt><a href="manos.html">hands</a></dt>
        <dd>notes on hands: abandoned or planted on streets, there are hands spread around the city. Hands of asphalt, hands of plastic and cloth, hands of shades. Reminiscent of building, making, lifting. Sometimes smoking, holding and warming. Gestures that fell off a hand, forgotten and missed. A pair minus one, a gesture in half. A motionless hand signaling direction. A wave of gloves that slipped off a pocket.
 </dd>

        <dt><a href="doubleexposures.html">double exposures</a></dt>
        <dd>notes on double exposures: on window panes, at night or certain hours under certain lights or certain darknesses, the inside and the outside lay flat on the glass, cables hanging with cars passing.</dd>

        <dt><a href="buildingshine.html">building reflections</a></dt>
        <dd>notes on building reflections: on sunny days, a building's window panes reflect onto the street in front. Xs and circles, shapes that they see fit. Movememnts that follow the sun, clocks to what they face.</dd>

        <dt><a href="twistedcups.html">glasses and cups on tables</a></dt>
        <dd>notes on drinking vessels: the lights of restaurants, of desks and bars, shine onto cups split light into new waves. The table becomes a screen for its projections. Hands twisting it into waves of values and shapes, always on the ground. </dd>
