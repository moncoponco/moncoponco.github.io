        <dt><a href="graffiti.html">graffiti</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains intriguing reminsencencs of name tags and grafitti on different surfaces. Through use, reflection and surface choice, the tag goes beyond two-dimensionality to comment on time, light and shadows.</dd>
        <!--gestures leaving behind a name, a symbol, a twist. Claiming local, territory, been there and done that. Illegal at night, or day, quick to not get caught. Sometimes on window panes that leave a shade behind, calligraphy and outlines, tags washed or fresh on surfaces that react and compliment.-->

        <dt><a href="hands.html">hands</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains a long lost and found list of gloves left on the streets of New York.</dd>
        <!--abandoned or planted on streets, there are hands spread around the city. Hands of asphalt, hands of plastic and cloth, hands of shades. Reminiscent of building, making, lifting. Sometimes smoking, holding and warming. Gestures that fell off a hand, forgotten and missed. A pair minus one, a gesture in half. A motionless hand signaling direction. A wave of gloves that slipped off a pocket.-->

        <dt><a href="doubleexposures.html">double exposures</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains window panes that act as a double exposure between the inside and the outside, juxtaposing retail spaces to trees, people and cars.</dd>
        <!--on window panes, at night or certain hours under certain lights or certain darknesses, the inside and the outside lay flat on the glass, cables hanging with cars passing.-->


        <dt><a href="buildingreflections.html">building reflections</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains sun reflections from one building to its neighbors, presentings Xs and circles among other shapes. Its position changes to the time of the day, following the sun like a clock.</dd>
        <!--on sunny days, a building's window panes reflect onto the street in front. Xs and circles, shapes that they see fit. Movememnts that follow the sun, clocks to what they face.-->

        <dt><a href="vessels.html">vessels</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains a variety of drinking vessels with lights that reflect in and from its shape. Wine turns the light red, certain shapes cause specific dripping patterns, and the glass rivets concentrate the light in distinct patterns.</dd>
        <!--notes on drinking vessels: the lights of restaurants, of desks and bars, shine onto cups split light into new waves. The table becomes a screen for its projections. Hands twisting it into waves of values and shapes, always on the ground-->
        
        <dt><a href="treasurehunts.html">treasure hunts</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains marking on the street that hint a playful treasure hunt sprawling through different metropolitan cities.</dd>

        <dt><a href="constructions.html">constructions</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains consturction moments, where linear mounted structures and protective sheets glitter in front of illluminated windows and the sun, playing with a three-dimensional conjunction of lines and lights.</dd>
        <!--notes: on -->

        <dt><a href="mirrors.html">mirrors</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains street mirrors made of different materials, playing with the idea of reflective feedback.</dd>

        <dt><a href="mheart.html">mheart</a></dt>
        <dd>Contains asphalt markings of the letter M with a heart or a plus and another letter. The goal is to collect all of the alphabet combinations.</dd>
