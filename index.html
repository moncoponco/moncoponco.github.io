And yet never grows?-->

        <dd>notes on tags: name tags and grafitti on different surfaces, they play with shades to create outlines and sit on glass to create shades.</dd>
        <!--gestures leaving behind a name, a symbol, a twist. Claiming local, territory, been there and done that. Illegal at night, or day, quick to not get caught. Sometimes on window panes that leave a shade behind, calligraphy and outlines, tags washed or fresh on surfaces that react and compliment.-->

        <!--abandoned or planted on streets, there are hands spread around the city. Hands of asphalt, hands of plastic and cloth, hands of shades. Reminiscent of building, making, lifting. Sometimes smoking, holding and warming. Gestures that fell off a hand, forgotten and missed. A pair minus one, a gesture in half. A motionless hand signaling direction. A wave of gloves that slipped off a pocket.-->

        <dd>notes on building reflections: the sun reflects from one building to its neighbors, it creates Xs and circles among other shapes, its position changes to the time of the day, following the sun like a clock.</dd>
        <!--on sunny days, a building's window panes reflect onto the street in front. Xs and circles, shapes that they see fit. Movememnts that follow the sun, clocks to what they face.-->

        <dd>notes on drinking vessels: lights that reflect in and from cups, especially visible in restaurants and in offices, wine turns the light red, certain shapes cause specific dripping patterns, light on glass turns it in a way that is fun.</dd>
        <!--notes on drinking vessels: the lights of restaurants, of desks and bars, shine onto cups split light into new waves. The table becomes a screen for its projections. Hands twisting it into waves of values and shapes, always on the ground-->
